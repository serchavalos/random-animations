# Recreating Google logo

Kudos to [Petr Tichy](https://ihatetomatoes.net/) and his great article "[Recreating the Google Logo Animation with SVG and GreenSock](https://css-tricks.com/recreating-the-google-logo-animation-with-svg-and-greensock/#0)"

This is how you run it on Mac

```
$ brew install nodejs
$ npm install
$ gulp
$ open index.html
```
